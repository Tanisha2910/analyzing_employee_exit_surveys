    "This project analyses exit surveys from the Department of Education, Training and Employment and the Technical and Further Education Institute in Queensland, Australia. Both datasets are CSV files, which I will use to answer the following question -- Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer? Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees? Neither dataset comes with a data dictionary explaining what each column contains, so the analysis primarily focuses on cleaning the data and dealing with null values."

    "The cells above show the basic structure of the Department of Education, Training and Employment dataset. Overall, there are 822 rows in the dataset. The total number of values in the ID column is 822 with 0 null values, as would be expected since every employee taking the survey has an ID number. The last five columns inquire into the employee's ethnic background. The only non-null values for these columns are \"Yes\" responses if the employee taking the survey identifies with the group named in the column. The columns ranging from 'Professional Development' to 'Health & Safety' could be dropped, since, in the absence of a Data Dictionary, the one letter responses in these columns are incoherent and will be of no help in the analysis. Given the questions posed in the initial markdown cell above, the only columns that have any direct relevance to the inquiries at hand are those dealing with an employee's age, length of time at the company, and self-reported job (dis)satisfaction, i.e. The column 'DETE Start Date' seems to indicate the year the employee started and the 'Cease Date' column the month and year employment ended. 'Role Start Date' seems to show when the employee's last held position began, and is not relevant to this inquiry. Assessing job satisfaction can be completed by examining the binary responses (True or False) in the columns ranging from 'Interpersonal Conflicts' to 'None of the above,' which appear to ask whether or not each feature of the job, listed in the column heading, was problematic for the employee. Given that the inquiry asks if job dissatisfaction was a reason for the employee leaving and not what dissatisfaction consisted of, these columns could possibly be collapsed into one column containing a True or False value for whether at least one True value appeared in the aforementioned column range or a sum of True responses. The column 'SeparationType' can be used to help sort and filter the reasons why employee's left the company."

    "The TAFE dataset also has a 'Record ID' column, which is similar to the DETE dataset's 'ID' column in that it can serve as a primary key (a unique value for each row) and contains no null values. The dataset contains 702 rows, but has 16 more columns than the DETE dataset. While there is a column documenting the year employment ended ('CESSATION YEAR'), there is no column showing start year. To include this information, the column 'LengthofServiceOverall...' (shortened for brevity's sake) will have to be deducted from the termination year. The questionnaire portion of the survey, aimed at collecting demographic and job satisfaction data, contains questions similar in content to the DETE survey, but the responses are categorical rather than binary for many of the questions -- that is, the answers contain a range of values from Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree values for a majority of the questions and only a few contain Yes/No values. Combining these datasets would be possible, if the job satisfaction questions could be reduced to a single value, and the termination type column normalized to allow for easier filtering and sorting."
